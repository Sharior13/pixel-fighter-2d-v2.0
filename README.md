## How to Play

### Controls

- **A / D**: Move your character
- **W / Space**: Jump
- **S**: Block Damage
- **Arrow Up**: Basic Attack
- **Arrow Left**: Attack 1
- **Arrow Right**: Attack 2
- **Arrow Down**: Special Ability
- **V**: Ultimate Ability

### Gameplay Flow

1. **Title Screen**: Click "Find Match" to enter matchmaking or create/join a room
2. **Matchmaking**: Wait for an opponent (automatic pairing)
3. **Character Selection**: Choose your character (30 seconds)
4. **Fight**: Battle your opponent until time runs out or someone's health reaches zero
5. **Results**: View the winner and return to title screen

## Architecture

### Server-Authoritative Model

The game uses a server-authoritative architecture where:
- **Client**: Captures player input and renders the game
- **Server**: Runs all game simulation, validates actions, and determines outcomes
- **Benefits**: Prevents cheating and ensures consistency across all clients
- **Trade-off**: Network latency (mitigated by 60 FPS synchronization)

### Key Systems

#### Input Buffer System
- Clients send inputs at 60 FPS continuously
- Server buffers up to 10 inputs per player
- Game tick processes one input from buffer per tick
- Ensures no input loss due to network jitter

#### State Synchronization
- Server broadcasts full game state 60 times per second
- Clients receive and render state directly
- High tick rate ensures visual smoothness
- No client-side prediction (simple, reliable approach)

#### Match Lifecycle
1. **QUEUE**: Players waiting for match
2. **CHARACTER_SELECT**: Choosing characters (10-second timeout)
3. **FIGHT**: Active gameplay (180-second max duration)
4. **ENDED**: Match finished, cleanup in progress

## Socket Events

### Client → Server
- `findMatch(mode, roomId)` - Request to join matchmaking
- `selectCharacter(characterId)` - Player selects a character
- `lockCharacter()` - Player confirms character choice
- `playerInput(inputs[])` - Send game inputs (60/sec during match)

### Server → Client
- `queueJoined()` - Confirmation of queue entry
- `matchFound({roomId, players})` - Match created
- `characterPreview({socketId, characterId})` - Opponent selected character
- `playerLocked({socketId, playerIndex, characterId})` - Opponent locked in
- `startMatch({roomId, players, gameState})` - Match begins
- `gameStateUpdate(state)` - Game state sync (60/sec)
- `abilityExecuted({socketId, ability, result})` - Ability notification
- `matchEnd({winner, finalStats, reason})` - Match finished
- `matchError({message})` - Error occurred
- `playerDisconnected(socketId)` - Player left the match

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io
- **Frontend**: HTML5 Canvas, Vanilla JavaScript

## Performance

- **Server Tick Rate**: 60 ticks per second
- **Client Frame Rate**: 60 FPS
- **Network Update Rate**: 60 updates per second
- **Input Latency**: ~16-33ms (1-2 frames)

## Future Enhancements

- Additional characters with unique movesets
- Power-ups and stage hazards
- Ranked matchmaking with ELO system
- Spectator mode
- Replay system
- Mobile touch controls
- Client-side prediction for reduced input latency
- Rollback netcode for better online experience
